# Engineering Calculator

Engineering Calculator is a command line application that functions as an interactive shell. It is designed for reusability and features an expression tree-based evaluator, allowing for flexible and efficient computation of mathematical expressions.

## Example Usage

```csharp
//basic arithmetic
3 + 4 * 2

//fractions
1/3 + 1/4

//trigonometric functions
sin(30) + cos(60)

//exponentiation
2^3 + 5^2

//logarithmic functions
log(100) + ln(e)

//complex expressions
(3 + 4) * (2 - 1) / sin(45)

//variable assignment and usage
x = 5
y = 10
x * y + sin(x)

//expression simplification
.simplify (2 * x + 3 * x) / 5
```
